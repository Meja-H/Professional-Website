Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet README
-------------------------------------

Hello, this project was created by Sumeja Hrnjic and Sarah Barker. Our website is a place that we began very recently. When this project was mentioned, we didn't know that we were going to be working together. We work together amazingly, we never disagreed about anything while creating our website. Each person brings a different skill set to the table, so together we can create something better than anything we can create alone.

We chose to create a website for Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet because we believe that this restaurant should have a better website than it had previously. Therefore, we created a website easier for possible customers to discover more about the business.


Whole Website:

-The restaurant, Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet, originally had a website that didn't offer enough information and wasn't appealing to the eye. So, one of us contacted the business and asked if we could create this website. They were more than happy to oblige and we quickly set up times to take pictures for the website.

-Our logo was originally the sign that is on the front of the restaurant. It is made to represent the Asian culture of the restaurant.

-We first started out with a layout from Treehouse but changed it to fit what we wanted. We mainly used one font throughout, however, for the header we used something that was a bit more fancy than the rest of the font on the website. We looked for fonts that were easy to read and professional yet unique.

-We also chose a color scheme that was somewhat suttle, but used red as an attention getter. We kept the background just white because it is more elegant and doesn't take away from the important information on the pages. For accent colors we have an off yellow for the navigation and footer text in order to make a distinction from the content text. 

-Our website looks good on phones, Apple Macs, and the computers we have at MAHS.

-We have a favicon on the tab of the web browser that is the restaurant logo, and works on Google Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. However, does not show on Safari (which no favicon seems to show up on). Even though it does not show up on the tab, it does not affect the website significantly.

-We had a Apple Mac to check our responsive on larger screened computers.

-We have been given an offer to sell this website to the restaurant. Their previous website was out of date and they loved our idea. Their old website is http://www.hibachigrillandbuffetjackson.com/. We have contacted them about what things they would like on the website and the color scheme.


Home:

-Our Home Page has basic information you need to know, including working hours, a map, and basic information about the restaurant. We also include links to our menu, phone number, email, and contact page.

-We also included a picture of the main buffet in the restaurant. This way the possible customers can see a bit of how the restaurant looks.


About:

-Our About Page we have a small description of what we are and when the business was started.

-To the right of the page, there are pictures of the manager/owner, the staff, the fountain located inside the restaurant, and under the pictures a video (embedded from YouTube) about the restaurant.

-We have included links to the restaurants Facebook and Twitter.

-All of the pictures were taken by Sumeja's iPhone.


Menu:

-Our Menu Page has six pictures of the different cuisine the restaurant offers. We could not include a written menu because it is a buffet.

-We have included pricing and descriptions of the restaurant and its' food.


Contact:

-Our Contact Page has a table that contains contact information. We made sure the table matches our color scheme. In the table, it shows our email, phone number, address, Facebook, and Twittter which are all linked so that the customer may contact the business.

-Clicking on the email will allow a possible customer to send any comments or questions.

-We also chose to add in a PHP form for any other comments or questions. The form is linked to the business's email, however, does not work because the website is not yet launched.


Testimonial:

-Our Testimonials Page has a completely different layout than the other pages, in order attract people who are interested in reading comments that previous customers have made.

-The color scheme is more with the off yellow and khaki that is in the navigation and footer text, but the text is the same dark brown color. 

-Each reply was taken from either Google or Yelp, and all the comments are linked to their associated website.


Catering:

-We added a Catering Page because the restaurant caters parties, no matter the size. There is extra information that needed to be given to those that are interested in such.

-There is also a nice button at the button linking you back to the menu page.

-Our regulations for catering are larger than the regular text around and has a faint red box around it.

-There are three pictures to the side that show different types of seafood that can be ordered, and plates that can be ordered for catered parties.
